# Creating a preact app from scratch

## Getting Started

Clone this repo and install dependencies with `yarn install`.

### Starting The Dev Server

To start the server and start hacking, run

```BASH
yarn start
```

This starter uses webpack-dev-server to spin up an Express server with Hot-Reloading capability. Changes to code in `.src` should cause pages to reload.
